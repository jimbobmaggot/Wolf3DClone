Ways to improve existing 3D Engine

Some way to insert game into engine
Better scratch pad support
Better textures (reading, blitting, image processing)
Some way to separate game and engine data
Add higher level rendering constructs (shaders, materials, meshes, transforms)
Add some form of automatic shader selection 
Add some form of primitive shapes (rectangles, spheres, triangles)
More flexible transform class (default values for projection and camera)
Non perspective views (orthogonal)
Rendering Engine
Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale
More Control over textures( filtering, formatting)
More friendly constructors
window should have more properties(center position, full screen, mouse locking)
Better vector math (normalization, +=, commonly used vector constants, swizzling support)
Option class/system
Centralized "level" or "scene" class that holds data game is using
Game object class
make all positioning name position
make naming consitant
make easier way to generate mesh
make easier way to generate texture coordinates
make time based on seconds not nano
make better way to copy vector
gie vectors an interpolation method
transparency support
Need Physics Engine
Sprite support
Good way to compare vectors
Vector2f cross product
Some way to display text
